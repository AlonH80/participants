If you have not done the first task [Send a Pull-request](PullRequest) then please do that first or at least review the steps there.

In the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/szabgab/codeandtalk.com) of [CodeAndTalk](https://codeandtalk.com/) there is a file called `missing_events.md`. It contains the Twitter account of a lot of conferences that are probably not collected yet. At least their twitter account was not in the conference JSON files when the `missing_events.md` was created.

Your task is to pick one of those twitter accounts and add the JSON file of the corresponding conference. Remove the entry from the `missing_events.md` file, and send a PR with those changes.

The conference JSON files are in the data/events/ directory and details about them can be found in the README file of the project.
