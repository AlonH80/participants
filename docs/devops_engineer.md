# DevOps Engineer

In some companies there are designated DevOps engineers while in other places DevOps is more a philosophy that your Developers also understand Operations and vice versa.
Here we'll cover subjects that are relevant to this bridging. If you'd like to become a "DevOps" then you'll probably have to be good at least in some of these:

* Version Control using Git
* (Version Control using Subversion might be also relevant in some organizations)
* (Version Control with some proprietary software ??)

* Using the Linux shell
* Networking (TCP/IP, DNS, domain names, etc.)
* Relational Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
* NoSQL Databases (MongoDB, Redis)

* Test automation (Unit tests, Integration tests etc.)
* Continuous Integration using Travis-CI and Jenkins

* Virtual Machines e.g. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* Automation of Virtual Machines: [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* Containers - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

* Logging and Monitoring. On the [monitoring](https://code-maven.com/monitoring) page you can find some notes.

* Configuration Management: [Chef](https://www.chef.io/), [Puppet](https://puppet.com/), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) are the most popular tools for this.
