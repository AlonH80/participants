Travis CI (CI = Continuous Integration)

One can configure Travis-CI to react to every `push` to a GitHub repository and to run code specified by the developers of that project.

* Locate a GitHub project written in your programming language that is not using Travis-CI yet.
* Check if it has any tests and if you can execute them on your computer
* If not, add a simple test
* Configure [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to automatically run the tests of this repository.
* Send a pull-request to the owner.

The https://pydigger.com/ site indexes Python projects and provides a list of Python projects that are hosted on GitHub but have not configured Travis-CI yet. https://pydigger.com/stats
