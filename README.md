### Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/szabgab/modiin-co-learning.png)](https://travis-ci.org/szabgab/modiin-co-learning)


See our [wiki](https://github.com/szabgab/modiin-co-learning/wiki) pages for details.

### Goals and values

Our goal is to improve our employability by helping each other learning new skills needed in the hi-tech world.

We think mutual help and continuous education is key to our long-term success in this world.

We think that that one of the best ways to learn is to help others to learn so from the beginning we expect our participants to help each other and especially help the newcomers.
Our participants are diverse in their skillset and background from absolute beginners to seasoned
developers.

We believe that working on Open Source and Free Software projects is both useful to us and a small contribution to make the world a better place.


### Among the skills you will learn are

* Version control with Git and GitHub
* Using Linux
* Writing Unit and Integration Tests
* Both back-end and front-end development.

* Learn to [update a GitHub project](docs/UPDATE_PROJECT.md) after the original repo ('upstream') made progress
* Fork the project [python-with-test](https://github.com/szabgab/co-learning-python-with-test), set up Travis-CI and submit a PR from a branch. (We we will comment on the PR)
* Take the [python-without-test](https://github.com/szabgab/co-learning-python-without-test) repository. Write a test, set up Travis, send PR (We will comment on the PR)
