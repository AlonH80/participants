### Goals and values

Our goal is to improve our employability by helping each other learning new skills needed in the hi-tech world.

We think mutual help and continuous education is key to our long-term success in this world.

We think that that one of the best ways to learn is to help others to learn so from the beginning we expect our participants to help each other and especially help the newcomers.
Our participants are diverse in their skill-set and background from absolute beginners to seasoned
developers.

We believe that working on Open Source and Free Software projects is both useful to us and a small contribution to make the world a better place.

### Intro

When you join our meetings the first thing we usually do is have a conversation to learn a bit about your background and your goals to be able to
direct you to task that fit you best.

The first thing you need to learn, if you don't already know it, is using Git and GitHub for version control.
As a participant of our meetings you will get free access to the book [Collaborative Development using Git and GitHub](https://leanpub.com/collab-dev-git).
