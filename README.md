### Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/szabgab/modiin-co-learning.png)](https://travis-ci.org/szabgab/modiin-co-learning)

### Goals and values

Our goal is to improve our employability by helping each other learning new skills needed in the hi-tech world.

We think mutual help and continuous education is key to our long-term success in this world.

We think that that one of the best ways to learn is to help others to learn so from the beginning we expect our participants to help each other and especially help the newcomers.
Our participants are diverse in their skillset and background from absolute beginners to seasoned
developers.

We believe that working on Open Source and Free Software projects is both useful to us and a small contribution to make the world a better place.

### Among the skills you will learn are

* Version control with Git and GitHub
* Using Linux
* Writing Unit and Integration Tests
* Both back-end and front-end development.

# Introduction

In the hi-tech world and in the Open Source world programming sounds like the main thing while in fact there are plenty of other things one can do.
Some of them might be even more valuable than the programming part.

Neverthelese one of the main requirement from anyone in the hi-tech world is good communiation skill and ability to cooperate. Even if this is not
explicitly emphasized by many organizations.

When you join our meetings the first thing we usually do is have a conversation to learn a bit about your background and your goals to be able to
direct you to task that fit you best. In this written format it won't work so we'll just have to go over some kind of logical order.

The first thing you will need to learn, if you don't already know it, is using Git and GitHub for version control.

There are plenty of Version Control Systems (VCS-es) out there, but the most popular, especially in the Open Source world is Git.
It is a stand-alone VCS that you can use on your own computer alone, or you can use it internally in your company, or you can use a Cloud-based
solution that provides hosting for your Git repository. GitHub is the most popular among those Cloud services.
So to be clear: You can use Git on its own and you can use Git together with GitHub.

Version Control Systems in general have a couple of contributions to out life:
* They allow us to experiment with the files we have without the fear of "how to I get back to the previous state".
* They allow us to look at the history of our development to see older versions of our project.
* They allow us to locate the change that introduced a bug even if that was several weeks, months, or even years before we noticed the bug.
* They make it easy to collaborate on the same project.


# Tasks

* [Send a Pull-request](docs/PULL_REQUEST.md) to a GitHub project
* [Send Pull-request for CodeAndTalk](docs/PULL_REQUEST_FOR_CAT.md)
* Learn to [update a GitHub project](docs/UPDATE_PROJECT.md) after the original repo ('upstream') made progress
* Fork the project [python-with-test](https://github.com/szabgab/co-learning-python-with-test), set up Travis-CI and submit a PR from a branch. (We we will comment on the PR)
* Take the [python-without-test](https://github.com/szabgab/co-learning-python-without-test) repository. Write a test, set up Travis, send PR (We will comment on the PR)
* Hook up a project to [Travis-CI](docs/TRAVIS-CI.md)
* Add Unit tests to a project (Python, PHP, Ruby, Perl, JavaScript, C#, Java)
